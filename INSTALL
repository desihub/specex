This package depends only on HARP, which provides links to cfitsio and lapack.
One can find HARP on https://github.com/tskisner/HARP .

The compilation uses the "meta build system waf" which documentation can be found here http://code.google.com/p/waf/
(but you don't need to download anything).

Waf will look for a pkgconfig file for HARP.

If you don't have any, it can be autogenerated with a configure option (see below) provided the utility script 'harpconfig' should be available in your path.



Configuration :
./waf configure --prefix=WHERE
./waf
./waf install

You can try for more options :
./waf configure --help

Example :
./waf configure --prefix=$HOME/software --optimize=0 --debug=True --autogen-harp-pkgconfig=$HOME/software/lib/pkgconfig
./waf
./waf install
