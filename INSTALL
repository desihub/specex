This package depends only on HARP, which provides links to cfitsio and lapack.
One can find HARP on https://github.com/tskisner/HARP .

In particular, the utility 'harpconfig' should be available in the path.

The compilation uses the "meta build system waf" which documentation can be found here http://code.google.com/p/waf/
(but you don't need to downlad anything).


Configuration :
./waf configure --prefix=WHERE
./waf
./waf install

You can try for more options :
./waf configure --help

Example :
./waf configure --prefix=/home/jguy/software --optimize=0 --debug=True
./waf
./waf install
